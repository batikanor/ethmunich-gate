# Organizational
* This program uses the great RPC provided by Gateway.fm. We contacted them thoroughout the project and also provided them with a short insight mid-term. We hereby thank them for their kindness.

* This program, whilst not being connected to any of the sample challenges mentioned within the respective track, can be categorized as an 'AI meets web3' submission. However, It could also be used by investigators or those interested in investigating in real life, and thus can be considered a real-world use case submission, even though not all end-user populations would be targeted by it.

* Even though it only plays a minor side-role for this project, we also feel the need to mention that we also used a chainlink service for querying current ethereum data, as mentioned as a sub-challenge under the chainlink track. 

# How to prepare the working environment
* To prepare, you would ideally create a new python virtual environment, and download packages mentioned within requirements.txt. We recommend Python 3.10. This project was developed in windows and also tested on a mac. However, as downloading e.g. torch the same way in all machines may not be feasible, in order to run the program yourself you may need to take your local circumstances into consideration. Feel free to reach out to us in case we can be of any help. Also thank you for the great pretzels during the hackathon.
* Beware that this is a streamlit application. You may run it using one of the following commmands

```
streamlit run rpc_client.py
```


```
python -m streamlit run rpc_client.py
```
